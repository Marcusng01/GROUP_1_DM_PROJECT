    "### Introduction\n",
    "* We have collected data of 85 cafes in the KL and SELANGOR area using the SERP API playground which can be found here: https://serpapi.com/playground?engine=google_maps\n",
    "* These cafe data was collected via 5 queries in the SERP API playground. I saved the results of each query in a text file.\n",
    "* This resulted in 5 text files (Page 1.txt to Page 5.txt) that contain JSON-like data about 85 cafes in KL and SELANGOR area.\n",
    "* However, these files do not contain review data for the cafes. Instead it contains surface level data of the cafes ranging from the Cafe's Name, Opening Hours, Company Contacts and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Therefore, we have to complete the data collection process via a series of steps\n",
    "1. Extract the Title and Place_ID of each cafe.\n",
    "2. Use Place_ID and SERP API to query for user review data.\n",
    "3. Save the review data in a JSON file."

Their Pesto Chicken sandwich is particularly good. Their main strengths, however, are their desert options. Their sweet crepes and cakes are so good that you'll definitely order more than a few either for yourself or for sharing. The service is also very good as the staff are readily available and friendly. The cafe itself is spacious as they recently expanded to the next block beside them. The only thing is that there can be long waits at times and parking is a hassle in that area. Other than that, this is a great place for a casual lunch date or a dessert adventure. Highly recommended!\",\n",

Today, we finally stepped inside, and we were pleasantly surprised by our experience. This cafe exudes a cozy and comfortable atmosphere that instantly made us feel at home.\\n\\nThe menu offered a variety of options, and we decided to try their pasta and big breakfast. Both dishes exceeded our expectations. The pasta was perfectly cooked and seasoned, while the big breakfast was a delightful combination of flavors. We left the cafe feeling satisfied and impressed with the quality of the food.\\n\\nWhat stood out even more was the reasonable pricing. The cafe offers great value for the money, making it an excellent choice for a meal out without breaking the bank. We appreciated the fact that we could enjoy a delicious meal without worrying about exorbitant prices.\\n\\nMoreover, my wife, Angel, was particularly thrilled to discover a new place where she can relax and work when I'm not around. The cafe's ambiance and comfortable seating arrangement make it an ideal spot for getting work done while enjoying a cup of coffee or a meal.\\n\\nThe staff members were friendly and attentive, ensuring that we had a pleasant dining experience. The service was prompt, and our orders were served with care. We felt welcomed and appreciated as customers.\\n\\nBased on our positive experience, we will definitely be returning to this cafe in the future.

Great hospitality\\n\\nI am a fan of cozy cafes, so this is one of my favourites. Ordered fusion Japanese Ebiko pasta and it is very tasty. The orange fish egg is fresh, and the combination with seaweed, egg yolk and meat is so appetising. Price is typical Western around RM17 is reasonable. The only issue is that I’m still hungry xD\\n\\nThe cakes are more of the creamy type, which is also to my liking. Really high quality and I surely enjoyed unwinding in the cafe. The ambience is on point with the furniture, lighting and floor structure. I would only be fussy on soundproofing.\\n\\nIt is a relatively decent distance walking from Taman Midah MRT.

       "    'description': 'In Taman Midah lies a little charming hipster coffee place that serves tasty pasta and coffee with reasonable price. Their signature is the ebikko spaghetti which contains a large portion of spaghetti in a concoction of seaweed, ebikko and mayo with a fusion twist; it taste so good to the extent that anyone who dislikes mayo would find this surprisingly delicious. Anyone who prefers spicy meal would find their spicy shrimp aglio olio to be the ultimate perfect choice. A slight complaint on the spaghettis is that the noodles were overcooked causing the texture to be soft and soggy. Their coffee is undoubtedly a gem in cheras. They used Brazilian coffee beans on our visit today and the coffee profile is balanced, nutty and smooth; a perfect choice for any newcomer to the hipster coffee scene.',\n",

Their food is also more than decent, as are their very pretty looking sweets. They have interesting beans for sale and the staff are more than capable of making recommendations if you're unfamiliar with what's available.\\n\\nThis is now my (and my parents'!) local, and whenever I'm home I make it a point to get something new.

       "    'description': 'Visit date: 30/1/2024\\n\\nSimple interior with lots of natural lighting. Service was great and everything is reasonably priced.\\n\\nThey have 3 breakfast combos and 30% for coffee till 12pm. Good place for work. There’s free water and WiFi.\\n\\nThe toast looks very simple but oh so good 😋 It taste like there’s caramel in the spread. The signature chicken ramen (RM13.90) was surprisingly tasty and well portioned too. Pandan nasi lemak (RM10.90) was worth-it, good portion and yummy.\\n\\nSome description and pricing on the menu are a little confusing like how it’s an additional RM1 for ramen noodle when the picture shows ramen noodle and as for the nasi lemak, it actually comes with fried egg and chicken patty but it’s not mentioned instead it’s stated that for egg and patty, they are additional charges. Kinda confusing for us and we ended up having 2 patties and 2 fried eggs for the nasi lemak which was unnecessary. Perhaps owners can relook into the wordings of the menu and amend them.\\n\\nOther than that, everything was great. Place is clean, especially the toilet 👍 , food was yummy and service was prompt and good. Recommended!',\n",

It is just another cafe with ludicrous prices.\\n\\nThe drinks were mediocre as some commented, the coffee tastes weird, while the mocktails were bland.\\n\\nThe sourdough isn’t normal either, not the usual way I like it at least. The pasta dishes were fine though, but with that price you could get the same for cheaper somewhere else.\\n\\nOnly things I like was the menu being inclusive of tax and the service was pretty warm.

The cafe has a very cozy vibe with its rugged architecture yet modern look. The food is great and staff super nice.

The cappuccino was creamy and had a pleasant aroma, making it a delightful start to the morning. However, the breakfast platter didn’t quite meet my expectations.\\n\\nThe selection included a variety of items like sausage, bacon, waffles, and vegetables, but the overall taste was somewhat lackluster. The flavors were a bit muted, and some components felt a bit overcooked or under-seasoned. While the presentation was appealing, the actual taste didn’t quite live up to the visual appeal.\\n\\nThe ambiance of the cafe is pleasant, and it’s a comfortable place to relax with a cup of coffee. However, I would suggest they put a bit more effort into improving the taste and quality of their breakfast offerings to match the high standard of their coffee.',\n",

       "    'description': \"I've dined here twice so far. Airy space, they got comfy couch seats, some tables by the window too perfect to enjoy the rain with a hot coffee in hand, and the food was always on point. You order and pay by scanning a code at the table. You can also pay with the employees if you prefer. I had the pomodoro pasta with added chicken and the Sriracha eggs sandwich. Both were very good. I especially loved the sandwich bread, finally not the sweet fluffy kind but ciabatta style. Yum! The service is ok, nothing special. Since I paid online I only interacted 2s with the employees as they brought the food to me. No smiles or many words to be honest, though I think I was nice and thanked them. But the system automatically charges you 10% for service fyi, so I guess they don't have to worry about not getting tips lol all good, I have what I came for: great food and good music. In and out in 30min. Fyi you get a % money back if you make an account with them, and then next visit you can use that.\",\n",

The rm37 offer for 2 coffee and cakes is probably the way to go. We both ordered some pasta for our lunch experience and unfortunately I felt they were pretty mediocre. Not bad not great tasting. I did enjoy the peanut butter croissant and on that note, they are the larger variants with the center more towards doughy and chunky due to the filling which is a departure from  the classic airy buttery french croissants. The chocolate tart with some salt added was also brilliant.\\nThe rustic vibe is interesting and it is very spacious inside with plenty of tables.

Made a reservation the day before with some special requests which were happily accommodated. Great job by the team.\\n\\nService was prompt even though they were quite busy. The lunch menu starts at 11.30am, and ordering is via scanning a QR code on the table.\\n\\nI ordered the savoury bakes chicken, aubergine and pesto puff, crookie, classic croissant,  peach brioche crumble, grilled cheese toastie, and orecchiette pomodoro chicken.\\n\\nLet me start with the savoury pastry, it was so-so, not easy to eat as it crumbles. Felt oily as well but likely from the topping. The crookie was nice but like most sweet pastries, cloying after a few bites. Best to share it. The pasta and grilled cheese toasties were decent.\\n\\nThe price was, very much on the higher end of things. I would say almost difficult to justify the price versus the quality of the food.\\n\\nAll in all, a decent place with a nice ambiance. One of those Instagram friendly places to be seen and taken a photo for social media. Would I return, likely not unless the food quality and portions improve to match the price.\",\n",

I lost count of how many times I ate here, and it is still consistently good. We always come after our weekend morning walk.\\n\\nThe big breakfast is also of good quality. My Americano is also good.\\n\\nAnother thing I like is their cakes. We usually have rum and raisins which is super good.\\n\\nWaffle could be crispier, and the ice cream taste like not very vanilla, probably almond?\\n\\nFish and chips batter are those on the tender side, not as crispy as I like. The white sauce with green speckles in it is delicious!\\n\\nAll is good, but the service of one of the male crew (a little shorter, with black specs) is a little unfriendly. Maybe smile a little more, relax your tone of voice. It is a pity that your food and environment is this good but service spoils it. Just my 2 cents. 🙏',\n",

The ambience fits a cafe brunch standard although might face challenges as many shops within the neighbourhood are hawker food style.\\n\\nFood taste, the waffle was alright, salmon pesto pasta didn’t taste too much of the basil smell. Squid ink pasta did taste Malaysian flavours in there which I would say something different. The shakshuka probably needs improving, just too sweet to my liking and will require more herbs in it.\\n\\nI did not enjoy much the ambience as it was pretty hot despite the air conditioning. My little one crying throughout the lunch feeling uneasy whilst in the restaurant. Although that’s just my feel when I am here.',\n",

Sad to say if it was in a better location might have more customers. However, the food is fantastic we had brunch. The taste was acceptable for normal brunches. With a bit of fusions. The soup we ordered would be good to have a bit of salt. We could have asked for salt but didn’t might be our fault. So far the service was quick. There weren’t a lot of people when we went there. The staff were good. Not much conversations or recommendations from them. But probably because there wasn’t any promotions not that I know of. Went there during public holidays as well. Enjoyed the food. The place could need a bit of color and make it feel more lively. Also, the coffee was average',\n",

       "    'description': \"Was here for lunch on a public holiday. Not much of a crowd and can find a table immediately without any waiting time.\\n\\nWe ordered the Italian tuscan salmon (RM35) which was a creamy oniony sauce with panfried salmon served with bread. The bread was chewy and tasty, and sopped up every last bit of cream very well! Salmon was crispy and tasty, definitely recommend this dish.\\n\\nWe also had the wild mushroom pasta (RM25) which tasted like I was eating mushroom soup. There were a variety of mushrooms, mostly sautéed except the oyster mushrooms which were deep fried in batter. Quite a unique dish which you can't find anywhere else.\\n\\nWe also ordered their signature fruit tea (RM18) which came in a teapot. The tea leaves were really fragrant, and it was infused with orange and pear slices.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I didn't see any free flow of water being served here, but to be fair - I didn't ask either.\\n\\nStaff service were quick and friendly enough. Ambience was mostly concrete/industrial design, not the cosy kind, but still quite comfortable to spend some time lounging in.\\n\\nParking at Taman Yulek itself is notorious for being difficult/close to impossible, especially during peak lunch hours. So be prepared to park further and walk over.\\n\\nI saw they had slice cakes for about RM17 a piece, with flavours like butterscotch cookies, chocolate and burnt cheesecake. But I was too full to try any of the cakes, so maybe next visit.\",\n",

Owner wishes that people who walk into the cafe find peace, joy and healing.\\n\\nI think I experienced that indeed. Listening to the story was refreshing and inspiring -- the owner perservered and found peace and healing each time he encountered challenges. He stayed true to the calling. I took that away, ending my 2023 with new insights for  2024. Do grab the humble owner for a chat if you like some inspiration!\\n\\nThe atmosphere was peaceful and quiet. We wanted a cosy cafe away from the buzz of the city. This cafe is 20min grab/taxi ride from KL center where our hotel is - extremely easy.\\n\\nThe oat milk latte was nice. I drink oat milk latte daily but this one 'got feel'. The cheese cake is really GREAT. So moist inside, and the top layer burnt skin was so nicely done.\\n\\nOverall spending - RM160+ for 4 pax. We had spagetti, egg roll, big breakfast, nasi lemak, salad, 2 chèese cakes, 3 oat milk latte and 1 Americano. Quite a spread for what we spent, and walked away full in the stomach and in the soul.\",\n",

The meat was not like i expected sebab description website kata guna australian beef tapi bila makan, the whole thing rasa urat-urat liat macam tu, macam patty daging burger ramly!! My brother ordered beef sandwich pun macam tu texture daging dia.

Then we ordered brownie which was also disappointing sebab nampak orang review kata moist lah ape lah tapi kitorang dapat tu jenis kering berderai, aduh memang bukan rasa brownie langsung!!\\n\\nOverall, cafe ni overrated lah im sorry sebab from the video reviews yang i tengok, tak do justice to what ive experienced. Please do better especially the beef menu and brownie.\",\n",

I remember because I went there and that site used be where Aik Bee Sawmill used to operate in the past.\\n\\nSince I had an appointment nearby later and still had some time to kill, I made a quick turn as soon as I saw Verve Suites along the road. Parked by the road side as I didn't know where to park.\\n\\nThe cafe is indeed spacious and has a nice decor + potted plants to complement the cafe. I like the fact that they use wooden furnitures as I love natural woods.\\n\\nKombucha was the only choice that day as I wanted to save tummy space for the upcoming dinner. I looked at their menu - finger foods, soup, salad, toastie, rice and paste - a full blown menu which got me interested.\\n\\nI left the cafe and headed to my dinner place not far from here. The customer service was OK for me because I was the only customer at that time.\",\n",

       "    'description': 'We were there for Sunday brunch just before noon. There were only one patron then. There were 4 of us but only 2 sets of menu were offered and the waitress came back in 10 mins to take our orders. Our food & drinks were served in approx 20mins. Food presentation is good, portion larger than those cafes in the city. Mushroom spaghetti carbonara, Egg Benedict, Chicken Spaghetti & Mushroom Toasties were all good. Would prefer wholemeal seaded bread over Shibuya bread for the Egg Benedict dish. The coffee avocado smoothie doesnt taste as creamy as advertised. Rose latte was a good choice with just the right hint of rose flavour and not too overpowering coffee. Would be nice if they could add a slice of lemon in our plain water. Not much option for dessert, there was only red velvet cake on the counter. Overall, the cafe is cosy with lots of plants indoor, fairy lights on the ceiling and nice soft background music. Good place to chill with friends or family. Price is reasonable, parking either outdoor limited or register with the security to park in the building foc.',\n",

Not only is it troublesome to get parking as there are limited lots but you  have to register with the security which takes time.\\n\\nWhen we arrive no one even took notice of us or were there to assign us a seat. After seating, we waited for 20 minutes and no one came to take our order until I had to personally head to the counter to ask the waitress and she only kept saying they are busy, despite there only being five occupied tables, half of which were already served or near finishing their meals.\\n\\nNo offer of serving drinks first while waiting or even apologising for forgetting a customer. When ordering there were a lot of menu items but when asked many of the items were not available, some even needed longer time to prepare but did not mention it in the menu. So unfortunately we decided that if they were not interested in our business we 'd take it elsewhere. Can't comment on the food as we never even got to that part yet. But no one even bat an eye or apologised for their part as we left.\\n\\nThere was only a single waitress serving the entire place and all we were ever told we were busy, though it did not seem as such. Once you see service this bad, i would suggest there are better places to have your meals nearby. Would not be coming back ever.

The queue was long but moving fast, and the sight of various ingredients made my tummy growling.

Curry was flavourful but my fav in KD triumphed over this anytime, BUT (there's always a but) their crunchy sambal rocks! Somehow the sambal went very well with the curry and ingredients. Wished I asked for more.\\n◾Nasi Lemak - the son loves his national dish and he said that the sambal was not too sweet nor spicy, just right.\\n◾Drinks - mediocre at best!\\n\\nI don't mind eating the CCF again if I happen to be in the vicinity.\",\n",

For lactose intolerance people like me, I still feel the pain of the lactose even oat milk is used. The oat milk is relatively strong and overpower the match I have. Perhaps should change to oat side milk instead which compliment well with coffee and tea. I have added in the sugar syrup that come with it.

Noticed that other cafes in the area mostly serve pastries as main so if you\\'re looking for a heavy meal whilst you\\'re in the area, come to this cafe! Meal portion is generous, well worth the price. Mashed potatoes were a bit salty, but the minced beef was good, they complement each other. Aglio olio was not too bad. Mediterranean seafood pasta was surprisingly delicious, might try this one next time. Beverages were alright although do note that you have to STIR YOUR DRINK bc most of the time the sugar/syrup/chocolate is at the bottom. One of us didn\\'t and had the experience of tasting the flavor that is \"potong kaki\" when they were abt to be done w their drink 😂😅 . Ambience was good, we were lucky it wasn\\'t peak hour I suppose? Didn\\'t try any pastry. Service by staff is great! They also brought some deco to make our photos look nicer ❤️🥰',\n",

Coffee flavoured.\\n\\n2) Vlaai Apricot - Traditional Dutch pastry that was apricot flavoured. This was really nice. The vlaai alone suffices as a dessert, but we added on a scoop of ice cream too.\\n\\nI have seen the owners usually hang around near the entrance - they are a friendly couple.',\n",

       "    'description': \"visited this place in January '24 during the late lunch hour on the weekend. tried the Butter Chicken Dutch Baby and the Belgian Waffle with a single scoop of ice cream (Just Maastricht Waffle).\\n\\nThe Butter Chicken tasted more like Masala curry, different from the usual Butter Chicken found elsewhere. While their recipe includes some Masala and curry spices, it was still a bit lacking in flavor. As for the Dutch Baby, it wasn't the German pancake I expected; instead, it had a texture more akin to a Chinese pancake (apom) and didn't leave a strong impression.\\n\\nThe Belgian Waffle with ice cream had a thick, dry, and hard texture, not to my liking. I would not recommend it.\\n\\nOn a positive note, the service was good and attentive, and the business owner was very friendly. The ambiance was chill and spacious, making it a not-too-bad choice for a weekend hangout with friends if you don't set high expectations for the food.\",\n",

There aren’t that many tables available so I suggest making a reservation.\\n\\nThe food was AWESOME. Simple yet so good. Famed for their homemade pasta, Timothy did not disappoint. They are also playful with their flavours and combinations such as the Creamy Butter Masak Lemak pasta which had a spicy kick to it. The moussaka was absolutely delicious and the beef stew, tender and well marinated.\\n\\nThe service was warm and friendly and we didn’t have to wait long for our food. I also like how their food is so decently priced - everything that we ordered was between RM26-RM33!\\n\\nHighly recommended!!!',\n",

It was right after the first lockdown and I had chance upon this charming restaurant by accident when I came looking for the speakeasy bar upstairs. I returned the following weekend with mom and we both love the food here.  The ambience is great and the menu had a nice mix of items to make it interesting. The coffee is not bad but we did not get the chance to sample the variety of cakes on display each time we were here. Parking can be a challenge so we opt to come as early as possible. Eventually, it became a popular spot for cyclists to come and get their breakfast and refuel after their morning exercise. I should really come back again in the afternoons and sample their cakes as they looked delicious in the display counter.',\n",

       "    'description': 'A very discrete cafe built for the IG and Influencer crowd with its stylish interior and decor. Came for the pasta specifically and tried out 3 dishes:\\n\\nCreamy Carbonara. Could have been cheesier. Came a little cold to the table and it was the last dish to arrive. Had almost finished the other 2 which had came earlier when it arrived.\\n\\nCreamy Butter Masak Lemak. Spicy. Pedas. Not a bad thing if you like that sort of Asian twist in your pasta. The beef bacon was generous.\\n\\nChicken and Duck Talk. Probably the best of the 3. The salted egg flavour was evident and it really flavoured the pasta well. The fried chicken was crispy and complimented the meal. Couldn’t find any duck though.\\n\\nWe sat upstairs and did feel forgotten a little bit. Best you find a seat in the main hall downstairs to get their full attention.\\n\\nTrendy cafes tend to focus too much on the look but not Timothy. They do make an effort to cook a tasty meal.',\n",

       "    'description': 'We found this place on Google and decided to give it a try. The food was sensational, freshly prepared, and bursting with flavour. We ordered the pesto chicken sandwich. - Which was massive, so filling, and the pesto was delicious! and then chicken and duck pasta - a lovely creamy fresh pasta dish! Ordered a flat white and cappuccino with our meal! We had seen reviews on here about staff being rude and so weren\\'t expecting much but the waiter we had at first was so friendly even suggesting specials for us and bringing fresh water with a big smile on his face! After our food, we stayed for a while to chill- Nice music in the background would do a good place to hide from the rain  and get some planning done. After a while, we decide to get another coffee - an Americano and an iced latte along with a chocolate muffin. when the coffees came down, it was a hot latte, so we advised the waiter (different from the person we had ordered our dinner from) that we had ordered an iced latte. His reply was simply \"no\" and shook his head, saying we had  ordered a hot latte and walked off. Never in my life have I experienced this sort of rudeness. He clearly got the order wrong or misheard. Never ever have I seen in an establishment where they wouldn\\'t offer to remake the coffee as the customer had requested. We were so annoyed about this as clearly this staff member is negatively impacting the establishment and can understand where the bad service reviews are from. It\\'s a really nice cafe and lovely food but with service like this it really takes away and wouldn\\'t entice to go back at all!',\n",

       "    'description': 'How to become more hospitable:\\n\\nFirst of all, great food & architecture. This place has all the ingredients to become a successful restaurant.\\n\\nOnly, the service is leaking enormous. Some free advice to become more hospitable. Create more repeating guest, positive mouth to mouth marketing and improve your online reputation (and important for investors and owners increase the revenue 💰)\\n\\n1. Never hand out the bill to guests when they did not ask for it. This makes the guest feel that they need to leave + you will lose money because they are likely to not order anything else after.\\n2. NEVER, but never let the guests pay for their food & drinks while they are still eating or drinking. This is very unusual.    (When we where eating our main course the waiter passed by the table with a pin machine to let us pay. It was 21:15, I don’t think the place closes this early on a saturday, and even if it does, you first let the guests finish their food before collecting the payment. And if you are closing early always let the guests know through a “last drink call”.\\n3. Never serve out the food before the drinks. Most guests like to first receive their drinks before getting the food. Further, it looks unprofessional that the kitchen is faster than the bar.\\n\\nHopefully these things will be changed in the future, this will increase the guest experience.\\n\\nGood luck🍀',\n",

Using mainly floral designs, it gives a very British feel to the place. The reason behind this beautiful concept and interior is the owners who also owns an interior design consulting company which occupies the 2nd floor of the shop! 😍\\n\\nNow to the food. Not only is the food visually appealing, the taste was equally as good! 😋 Here’s what we tried:\\n\\n🥪 Philly Cheesesteak (RM32)\\n🍳 Devilled Egg (RM15)\\n🍜 Dry Curry Wonton Noodles (RM19)\\n🥗 Classic Caesar Salad (RM24)\\n🥣 Mushroom Crema (RM18)\\n\\nEverything on the table was flavourful and tasty! 😋 I was rather shocked to find out that the owners had no prior F&B experience but churned out those delicious dishes 😮👍 Even the presentation was on point - so appealing to the eyes 😍\\n\\nMy personal faves had to be the devilled eggs and Philly cheesesteak! The Devilled Eggs are essentially deep fried hard boiled eggs with its yolk being infused with creme fraiche and topped with streaky beef bacon, spring onions and mayo. Such an appetizing dish 😋\\nThe Philly Cheesesteak was really hearty comprising of toasted baguette filled with Angus ribeye, two kinds of cheese, charred onions, honey mustard aioli and gherkins. It comes with a side of salad and perfectly fried fries 👍\\n\\nThis place is worth your visit! Indulge in some wholesome hearty western food while enjoying the cozy ambience. There’s also a decent selection of Asian delights if you’re not in the mood for western 😆',\n",

       "    'description': \"We were surprised to learn that there was a Scoby 1.0 before this! This cafe is said to be an upgraded version of the previous setup, boasting a more aesthetically pleasing environment and an improved menu with new food items. We can definitely vouch for the renovation – the paint colors and lighting create a cozy and inviting atmosphere. However, the seating arrangement could be improved. It currently appears somewhat disorganized, with extra tables seemingly placed haphazardly.\\n\\nDuring our visit, we tried a few dishes:\\n\\nBig Breakfast: This is a fairly standard offering at most cafes these days — it includes a sausage, ham, scrambled eggs, tomato, mushrooms, potato, green vegetables, and two slices of toast.\\n\\nOchazuke: This dish features seared salmon cubes atop rice, accented with fish roe, stockfish flakes, and a creamy salmon bone broth to go with the rice.\\n\\nHot Latte: This was a good, standard latte.\\n\\nOverall, the portions, flavors, and presentation of the food were all quite decent, especially considering the price. The cafe is also pet-friendly, so expect to see customers' furry companions around.  We had a pleasant dining experience and will definitely return to try more of their menu.\",\n",

       "    'description': 'Tbh, my review will be 2 star. 1 star for kitchen people because they were nice enough to accommodate customer request and ask for feedback for improve purpose. Another 1 star for the nice cafe deco. I feel all 3 staffs just working because they need to work. Like no passion for hospitality industry. 1 second smile in front customer then change face straight. Like forced politeness eh. As if they’re not paid enough salary to perform.\\n\\nThey served us a spoiled hojicha cheesecake and after asking them why it tasted awfully sour and bad, they manipulate customer saying missed recipe to put lemon so it’s sour. Hello it’s obviously spoiled. When they asked us to choose another cake and we chose tiramisu, the boss is more concerned about RM4 extra and asked us to pay more.\\n\\nSo cheap mentality boss who cares more about money than customer’s well being. Ownself can’t take care of quality assurance but want to charge customer more. Can avoid this kind of cafes. Later get food poisoning and get blamed “karen” all the while knowing it’s their own fault.\\nps : it’s ridiculous to eat pasta in those pans. Jokes on you because you didn’t have to replace a cake if you’re so sure it was fresh and “soooo good” 😂😂. And yes, please do enjoy the review permanently. We all know what happens to f&b who can’t take criticism :)',\n",

Before this we only come for desserts (CreamPuff) which was also soooo GOOD! (Came twice for just the creampuffs)\\n\\nWe ordered ice water only and it came in papercups. It was free though.\\n\\n4.

Got myself the beef pizza I think and it’s delicious. It’s not salty at all and that makes good pizza outstanding plus with the leafys around it doesn’t cause that harsh of a food coma. Also the lemon tea is good!\\n\\nHospitality was all on honesty and it was certainly enjoyable here. Would come again if I can.',\n",

Nestled in Sri Hartamas and newly opened in February 2020, Daydreamers immediately captivated us with its lush greenery and charming Arabian-style lamps, evoking a sense of tranquility and natural beauty.\\n\\nWhile I've sampled Iranian cuisine before, the dishes at Daydreamers, prepared with grandmother's recipes, truly stood out. Each bite was a delightful revelation of flavours and textures, leaving us pleasantly surprised.

       "    'description': \"I stumbled upon @daydreamerscafe at Plaza Damas and it's a wonderful spot for breakfast and brunch. The food is delicious, reasonably priced, and the service is great. I will definitely be returning\\xa0 to try more items on their menu.\\n\\nWhat we had :\\n\\nSunrise\\xa0 Rm14.9\\n*The avocado toast with scrambled egg and feta was simple, healthy, and satisfying. Packed with protein, it's a great choice!\\n\\nThe Sizzeler Rm19\\n*I was skeptical about the creamy pesto and chili padi Alfredo sauce pasta at first, but I ended up liking it. The sauce was delicious—creamy, spicy, and definitely got me a little sweaty while eating.\\n\\nBaklava\\n*The waiter kindly let me try their baklava, but I found it overly sweet. If you enjoy very sweet desserts, this might be for you.\\n\\nTotal Rm66.6\\n.\",\n",

       "    'description': 'The Place: Its a shop lot turned cafe but beautifully styled and decorated. Due to its size, there arent that many tables as you would see in a moderate size restaurant. Hence also, if you come during peak hours, yep, you gonna have a \" Shushi Zanmai\" que.🤭 Oh im not gonna tell you the off peak hours for fear the crowd will come during my fav time. 😂So u gotta find it yourself.\\n\\nOnce u have a table, it might be very close to the other patrons  making it quite less cozy to have your lovey dovey chat with your gf/ bf. But if you dont mind that, its a non issue.\\n\\nThe food: I tried the Moroccan salad and it was delicious. The portion is larger than average and just having that for brunch, its definitely filling. The salad is different and due to this delicious flavourful  salad, for any salad meal next time, i put this cafe  as my choice, next to Chef Wans Smoke Salmon salad in his cafe in TTDI. Nice.\\n\\nSo I read a review about  the 45 min que and 1 hour food delivery. Maybe I guess i arrived at the right time since i immediately got a cozy table and service was pleasant and fast.\\n\\nI hope this cafe will grow and finally occupy a bigger location in plaza damas. They made a good start as a new cafe. Well done.',\n",

We indulged in a delightful brunch, savouring dishes like Japanese carbonara pasta and Hawaiian pizza, complemented by garlic butter sourdough and crispy fries. Our beverages—a creamy flat white and a robust black coffee—perfectly accompanied the meal. The atmosphere was jubilant, highlighted by a festive birthday celebration for Senna and Kiptan, 15 and 12-year-old dogs respectively. This serendipitous experience was not only a feast for the taste buds but also a heartwarming gathering that enhanced our day.',\n",

So, so, so disappointing from you guys. Both items combined cost RM53, pay upon ordering, cost us 2 hours of our time and finally they gave us the carbonara in a takeaway bowl. All was mixed in so can't keep over night, what good is a dinner serving when it's only available at 10pm+ after we got home, and must be finished ASAP as food already cross contaminated? So we eat at home at 10pm+. And the carbonara.. so do disappointing too. Pasta overcooked, carbonara sauce doesn't go with the bonito flakes on a takeaway as the food is not hot or fresh already. Having paid RM25++ for the carbonara, we were so disappointed and so hard to eat this. A note to the establishment: If you can't handle the volume of order at peak hour, be honest and offer solutions. Not just cover up after cover up. Seems like all you guys wanted is just to sell your expensive food without caring about your customers.\",\n",

       "    'description': \"Upon entering the restaurant after midnight, I was disappointed to discover that many of the dishes listed on the menu were unavailable, despite the restaurant's purported closing time until 3am. This was disheartening as I had hoped to indulge in a late-night meal with a diverse array of options to choose from.\\n\\nCompounding the disappointment was our initial seating arrangement, which placed us in close proximity to the children's play area.\\n\\nConsequently, the atmosphere was filled with noise and distraction, prompting us to request a relocation to a quieter table. However, even after the move, the clamor persisted, detracting from the overall dining experience.\\n\\nOpting for the Nissin Noodle soup, I anticipated a flavorful and satisfying dish. Regrettably, the soup failed to meet my expectations, tasting rather ordinary and lacking any noteworthy flavor elements. Priced at RM12.90 before taxes and charges, it felt somewhat overpriced given its mediocre quality.\\n\\nTo complement my meal, I ordered a honey lemon drink with the expectation of a harmonious blend of sweetness and citrus. Unfortunately, the drink leaned heavily towards the lemon side, with the honey flavor barely discernible, resulting in a beverage that bore more resemblance to lemon tea than a honey lemon drink.\\n\\nReflecting on my experience, which encompassed limited menu options, a noisy ambiance, and lackluster food quality, I would deem it average at best, warranting no more than a 3-star rating.\",\n",

It is strangely quiet for lunch time.\\n\\nThe tables are spaced out comfortably. The interior decorations are nice and funky. However, they push many unused items into the corners here and there, which ruins the overall ambiance.\\n\\nFood here isn’t bad. The Nanyang Curry Mee is filled with ingredients such as tofu puffs (tau pok), tofu skin (tau kee), fish balls, and chicken strips, and of course the yellow noodles. Yellow noodles used are the stringy variety. The curry soup base is flavorful.\\n\\nThe Wine-Soup Lala Beehoon (vermicelli) is also good. The clams (lala) is fresh and plentiful. The soup base has a good balance of flavor without the wine being overpowering.\\n\\nThe Salt and Pepper Chicken Chop is just average. While the batter used is tasty, the flavor is all in the batter itself. The salad is covered in mayonnaise, a little too much of it. The mayonnaise should have been set aside for the customer to choose the amount they want.\\n\\nThe Tea with Milo (chocolate drink) is just normal. The Milo taste is stronger than the tea so it just tastes like Milo.\\n\\nOverall the food is good. Service is good.',\n",

       "    'description': '14th April 2023 — If you’re looking for a rich and creamy Chinese style curry mee, here is the place.\\n\\nHad an exemplary service by the guy who corrected my order (a mid age guy, the only one who’s friendly with us). He  replaced the curry mee because I asked for no bean sprout (taugeh). Even got a complimentary honey lemon tea for the hassle of their ordering app. Apparently my request went elsewhere so they missed it? Somehow.\\n\\nThe Fish & Chips were average for the price. Portion wise; imagine the fish as side dish while the salad, fries and mint sauce are the star. For me, tartar sauce would be a better pairing.\\n\\nHad their lemon poppyseed cake too, good enough to end your course or take away for later.\\n\\nOverall, all delicious. They have varieties in the menu perhaps worth trying next time. Only that, they use some sort of scent in the restaurant which was a bit off for me. It’s a restaurant, not a boutique. Other than that, kinda cool that they have shisha for groupies to lepak.',\n",

𝐓𝐮𝐧𝐚 𝐌𝐞𝐥𝐭 𝐒𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐰𝐢𝐜𝐡 (RM23) 🐟 - Tuna sandwich with melted cheese served in fresh homemade baguette with seasoned fries. The portion size at Gajah Tiga lives up to its name. Get ready to feast at this neighbourhood cafe as their sandwich is enormous 🥪 Tuna Melt is the ultimate\\xa0sandwich\\xa0with a flavorful tuna fish mixture, slices of cheddar cheese, freshly sliced tomatoes all\\xa0melted together in a skillet on a thick, crispy golden bread. This sandwich will literally melt in your mouth! The bread is made freshly in house by their professional bakers and you can tell by the fluffiness of it 😍🍞 The jumbo size might be intimidating, but once you get a good bite of it, you can’t stop going in for more 🫦 This is a meal so simple yet so decadent, that an overarching sense of euphoria prevails throughout. Not to mention how good the fries and salad at the side were 🥹❤️\\u200d🔥\\n2. 𝐂𝐮𝐜𝐮𝐫 𝐔𝐝𝐚𝐧𝐠 (RM12) 🦐 - Founder's family recipe, passed down 3 generations. Prawn fritters served with Thai Chilli Sauce 🌶️ The cucur udang here isn’t like any other!! Here me out 🤭 It’s soft, slightly doughy and fluffy so it gives a nice chew to it; plenty of fresh prawns which are peeled (I love how they removed the shell); the batter used was mouthwatering 🤤 Pair it with their Thai Chilli sauce which is packed with heat and sweetness at the same time 🔥 Golden goodness ⭐️\\n3. 𝐑𝐨𝐭𝐢 𝐉𝐚𝐥𝐚 𝐊𝐚𝐫𝐢 𝐊𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐠 🥔 (RM6) - A hotel serving Roti Jala at RM6 only?! So affordable and they do not compromise on the taste! The curry is packed with oomph and a heartwarming deluge of curry richness 😚 The Roti Jala itself was a masterpiece but what really brought out the beauty in this dish was their thick flavourful potato curry which was flawlessly executed 👍🏻 Chef Kiss 💋\\n4. 𝐁𝐮𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐏𝐫𝐚𝐰𝐧 𝐒𝐚𝐝𝐨 (RM34) 🍤 - Their special Sado Sauce is a creamy butter chill sauce created in 2014 using a unique recipe. 🤩 Deep fried breaded prawns served in signature Sado Sauce, accompanied with garlic fried rice, salad & clear soup. A complete set or shall I say a killer combo 😏 The sado sauce was rich, creamy, and also imbued with elegant curry leaf fragrance, subtle spice notes, and a touch of heat. The buttermilk sauce was hella good, kinda wish they gave more as it was finger licking good 😝 Quite the delightful medley of buttery richness, oceanic flavours, and sprightly chilli padi.\\n5. 𝐁𝐢𝐡𝐮𝐧 𝐆𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐠 𝐒𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐚𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐞 (RM18) 🥡🥢 - Stir-fried rice vermicelli with chicken squid, prawns and vegetables and a fried egg 🍳 Nice dish if you’re craving something light as the mee hoon isn’t heavily flavoured. The prawns were super fresh too 🥰🦐\\n6. 𝐁𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐧𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐈𝐜𝐞 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐦 (RM8) 🤎🍨 - Gajah Tiga’s signature Chocolate Brownies served with ice cream and chocolate drizzle 🍫 The brownie was super fudgy, moist, and chocolaty, with crispy edges and crackly tops 🤤 So sinful yet delightful 🙈 My newfound guilty pleasure. The ice cream melts from the hot fudgey brownies making it extra creamy and moist! Can’t think of a better duo 😍\\n7. 𝐒𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐏𝐮𝐟𝐟 (RM8) 🐟 - Spicy and fishy 😋 Loved the flaky puff pastry! 🥐\\n8.

       "    'description': \"Disappointing Experience at Ruma Puteh\\n\\nMy recent dining experience here left much to be desired. Despite the active promotion on social media, the reality fell short in various aspects.\\n\\nService:\\nThe service was a significant letdown. Despite the restaurant being relatively empty, the wait time for both the main dish and dessert was unreasonably long – 45 minutes for the main dish and 35 minutes for dessert. The staff appeared disorganized and indifferent, with waiters lacking basic knowledge such as table numbers. Their nonchalant attitude towards customers waiting for their orders was evident and disappointing.\\n\\nAmbiance:\\nWhile the ambiance of the restaurant was pleasant, with a nice atmosphere, the presentation of desserts and pastries was lacking. The cake rack and pastry display were both empty and uninviting, detracting from the overall dining experience.\\n\\nTaste:\\nDespite the extended wait time, the taste of the food did not justify the delay. The kunafa was deemed average, lacking the wow factor one would expect from a specialty dessert. Similarly, the ikan bakar set, which took 45 minutes to prepare, failed to meet expectations. Despite the anticipation built by the lengthy wait, the dish turned out to be just average, lacking the flavor and quality one would hope for.\\n\\nOverall, my experience at here was disappointing. While the ambiance was pleasant, the poor service, extended wait times, and lackluster food quality overshadowed any positives. It is evident that significant improvements are needed, particularly in terms of service efficiency and food quality, to live up to the restaurant's active promotion.\",\n",

The same for my drink, iced latte, more water than milk.\\n\\nOne of the dishes we ordered were seafood aglio olio. Pasta was sooo nice, but! The prawns were not fresh at all. Very. I hope the cafe can take the seafood’s freshness more seriously as this is one of the food poisoning causes.\\n\\nWe also ordered fried rice with salmon & salad with mango sauce (forgot the name), such a refreshing fusion. Though the fried rice flavor can be a bit overwhelming, u might want to add-on white rice if the fried rice is too much for u.\\n\\nLastly it’s the RUMA ikan bakar set. Lovely! The grilled bass is big, u can share it with 3 people and maybe 2 for bigger eater.\\n\\nNothing exceptional to comment about the customer service, they came to serve foods then came to send the bill.\\n\\nBEST thing for Muslims — they have surau.\\n\\nThe place is really instagramable. Many nice spots for photo & video. However, the aircond was not cold at all, and at 3pm we were sitting in the aircond area, aircond-less with fan blowing hot air. So until they really got the aircond fixed, just come in the morning or night, during less hot temperature. -end-',\n",

       "    'description': 'I have visited this place when they first opened and their cocktails are very good. I love the big airy space especially the one with the airwell where you can literally drink under the stars. Back then, during the last Sunday of each month, there was afternoon Sunday roast where we can enjoy barbecue meat, vegetables and music from a live band. The barbecue was very good and it is one of my favourite way to spend Sunday afternoons then. The plate was huge and I have always enjoyed tucking in to the juicy, tender roast. Even the corn was delicious. Of course, as per my usual modus operandi, I returned frequently to sample as many cocktails on their menu as possible. I think I have covered almost all of their crafted cocktails and now, I plan to check if they have a new menu so I can pop by again.',\n",

More good place and good people in Petailing but not this one !\\n\\nWe always respect every country's rule.That's why we always asking if we can smoke to every cafe before we want to buy or stay.\\n\\nAnd Your Waitress say yes and even give us ashtray?(the astray with gold bow on the photo) we always ask to the cafe or store before. Badly for us to ask your cafe,around there much give us the permission but there's no coffee. But thanks for your knife to us. If you want to be fair you can stop us for stay and buy to your cafe when you see us for the first time we are smoking. And you can say to us without bringing knife. Did you want to kill us? Remember you waitress were allowing us to smoke outside,that's the first things we ask to your cafe.\\n\\nWe know we only foreigner and always respect every country and respect each other. And this is happend only in your cafe when we are in Kuala Lumpur.\\n\\nAnd remember total we spent almost RM 100 on your cafe bro and then we can got killed by your KNIFE ,and when you just came late and then doing something rude to us?you just came late before your waitress give us the permission.Seriously staff in this cafe have problem with atttitude to customer.\",\n",

       "    'description': 'I visited the Komunal Cafe with a 50% discount deal from Eatigo app. The staff were very courteous and explained the process well. I ordered at the counter and paid at 4.18pm. The drinks came promptly and were refreshing. I enjoyed the mango & lychee mocktail and the affogato.\\n\\nThe food, however, was not up to my expectations. The fish and chips had a thick and doughy batter that did not complement the fish. The tartar sauce was scarce for the portion. The chicken carbonara had tough and chewy chicken that did not match the otherwise delicious pasta and sauce. The churros were hot and crispy, but the chocolate sauce was dull and thin. The most frustrating part was the long wait time for the food. It took almost 40 minutes for the carbonara and churros to come.\\n\\nThe best part was the ambience. The restaurant had a cozy and welcoming environment. The staff were super friendly and attentive. They deserve a lot of credit for their service.\\n\\nOverall, I was not very happy with the food quality and the wait time. I think the restaurant can do better on these aspects. I will give them another chance to try their other menu items, but I hope they can improve these issues soon.',\n",

The vanilla frappe's sweetness is potong kaki level. Mushroom soup is not mushroomy enough - taste more like a chicken soup.\\n\\nBut I must praise you for your pesto pasta and also the churros. The pesto flavor is strong enough and the churros crispy outside, tender inside. Chocolate sauce is too little, only a bit at the bottom of the bowl, making it difficult for us to dip the churros.\\n\\nEnvironment is comfy and beautiful for chit chatting.\\n\\nAreas of improvement - please make sure when you send the food, you also ensure there is cutleries. For the few times you send us the food, I think there are at least 3 times you did not bring us the cutleries.\",\n",

Super nice and polite. We ordered a set to share. We usually do this at new place to test out their food before ordering more. Auntie not only gave us extra set of cutlery and bowl, she even gave us an extra bowl of soup. Told us that given the current weather, it's good to have some soup.\\n\\nPrice wise - given the location, it's ok. They have weekday promotion now - buy 4 sets, get 1 set free. In that sense, it's quite worth it. Average set is around RM20. Comes with the main dish, drink and sweet potato fries. Despite sharing, both of us were quite full at the end. We ordered a takeaway dish and my son gave it a super thumbs up. He's a damn picky eater.\\n\\nLocation wise, it's right at the other end of the street closer to the main road (a couple of shops from Impulse). Thus, lesser foot traffic there.\",\n",

The owners (I think) were doing their work on a table in front of the main counter and their huge 3 month old puppy is sat below the table. They greet you with friendly smiles and usher you in. Got to say the 1st floor dining didn\\'t give me the same feel. In fact, it looked a bit bare. The 3 air cond units were barely enough to keep the place comfortably cool.\\n\\nOverall, it was a pleasant dining experience. Service was attentive - you press the call bell and someone comes to you pronto. Food did not take long to come. Menu was eclectic. To those who have problems deciding, just flip to the \"Bestsellers\" pages!\\n\\nSukiyaki (with kampung chicken) was delicious. Ingredients were fresh, soup was light and they refilled the soup once. We liked the lamb too; it was nicely marinated and cooked to our requirement (medium). The soft shell crab on the pasta was crunchy. Pasta (aglio olio style) could have done with a bit more garlic. The mango salsa salad failed the test. For starters, the base of the salad should have a simple dressing say extra virgin olive with a squeeze of lemon. The mango salsa itself lacked oomph and got lost in the plain salad leaves.\\n\\nWe took away a slice of chocolate cake and bak chang. Cake was ordinary but the bak chang was very good.\\n\\nThere are many (pricey) dessert choices here. The cafe is a nice place to hang out. Will return to try some other dishes.',\n",

RM200 for 3!\\n\\nHaven't had a cafe brunch and ended up spending so much.\\n\\nJust ordered simple dishes like Butternut Squash Lentil Risotto with added chorizo (price became RM50), Carbonara, Bread basket, Seafood stew, ice latte, Earl Grey Chocolate. Plus plus became slightly more than RM200!\\n\\nThe Butternut Squash Lentil Risotto is quite delicious I have to say, but the chorizo added was more like boiled chorizo, quite meaty tasting. Frying it would probably have nicer flavour.\\n\\nThe Carbonara was supposed to be cooked in chicken fat, so it's a little too 'chikedy' for our liking.\\n\\nSeafood stew as you can see from the photo, looked as though it's packed with seafood, but on closer look you can see it had more croutons than seafood (see the photo with all the left over croutons). Taste wise is ok, but it was quite a small bowl with not much seafood.\\n\\nBread basket was toasted sliced bread with butter and balsamic vinegar and olive oil. There were 2 slices of seeded bread, those were tasty, and the balsamic vinegar and olive oil combination was quite good. I like the taste of the balsamic vinegar that they used.\\n\\nDrinks were alright. Earl Grey chocolate seriously just tasted like chocolate drink, couldn't taste the Earl Grey. Ice latte was a very small cup.\\n\\nIf the price was 20% cheaper for what they dished out, I'd probably give them a higher rating, but for this price, it's upper mid range and I would expect more.\",\n",

I personally love Mentaiko Pasta, the unique taste that couldn't find elsewhere. We ordered a medium cooked beef for the Angus Beef Don, thus it was solid and tough. But overall taste great as well. We also tried a Spiced Chai Latte. It was a little too sweet and milky for us because we expected the spice kik to be stronger. Overall, we would love to recommend this place and definitely come back again for more menu items and desserts.\",\n",

Free water, self service, was available too.\\n\\nI didn't get to try any of their mains as I chanced upon this cafe only after lunch.\",\n",

Their seared chicken chop was so delicious, can taste the freshness. And it comes with very generous portion, definitely able to fill up your tummy. And their mixed passionfruit mocktail is really refreshing.\\nThen decided to go visiting this cafe, never disappoint me, tasted their seafood marinara, generous in portion of seafood as well as freshness! Thumbs up! Love the bench sitting, especially me time , in do not disturb mode 😊\\nMust try!',\n",
